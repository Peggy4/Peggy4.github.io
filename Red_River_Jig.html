	<p> The Red River Jig is a traditional dance originating from the historic Metis Nation.  It combines the intricate footwork of the Scottish and Irish Reels with elements of the First Nations powwow to create a new dance form.   </p>  
	<h2>Basic Steps </h2>
	<ol>
		<li> Two partners face each other standing on the balls of their feet</li>
		<li> When the dance starts, each partner shuffles to the right and then to the left.  Every third shuffle, the foot is swung backward to skip a beat of the music. </li>
		<li> Once the basic steps have been mastered, fancier <a href="http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/pageant/07/redriverjig.shtml">footwork</a> can be introduced to add interest.  </li>
	</ol>
