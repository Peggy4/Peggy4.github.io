	<h2>What is Metis Beading?</h2>
	<img src = "metis-beadwork1.jpg" alt = "a photo of a flower done in Metis beading">
	<p> Metis beading originated in the Great Lakes and Red River regions in the late 18th century.  Women would decorate clothes and household items with bright, colourful beads.  Because of their unique patterns, the Metis are referred to as "Flower Beadwork People".  Today, the art is displayed in museums and can be bought from Metis women who still create it.  </p>
	<h2> What have I created?</h2>
	<p> In my immersion experience, I had the opportunity to participate in Metis looming to create a bracelet. </p>
	<p> To make a bracelet through looming, here are some materials that you will need: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>thread - any colour will work, but you should pick a colour that will blend in with your design</li>
		<li>scissors</li>
		<li>colourful, tiny beads </li>
		<li>a sewing needle</li>
		<li>a pattern - this can be printed off from the internet</li>
		<li>a loom stand - this can be purchased from a craft store</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Instructions:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Find a pattern that you are going to use for your bracelet.  It should show each individual bead's location.</li>
		<li>Cut a piece of thread the length of your fingertip to your heart</li>
		<li>Follow the loom's package for how to string your loom.  You will want there to be one more thread looped than there are beads wide.  Ensure that your thread is tight.</li>
		<li>Cut another piece of thread the same length as before.  Attach one end to the loom and another to the needle.  Make sure that your needle has a good tail of thread.</li>
		<li>Going from right to left on your pattern for the bottom row, put the beads on your needle and push them to the bottom of the thread.</li>
		<li>Bring your needle underneath the thread, placing it on the other side.  Pull the thread tight so that the beads are sitting between the thread in the spaces.</li>
		<li>Holding the beads in place from underneath, bring your needle to the beads level, stringing the thread through the beads on top of the original thread.</li>
		<li>Pull your string tight and push the beads close to you.</li>
		<li>Continue steps 5-8 until your pattern is complete.</li>
	</ol>
