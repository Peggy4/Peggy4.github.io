	<h2> What is this project all about?</h2>
	<p> This semester, each person in our inquiry class is dedicating five months to one area of study, mine being about the contemporary Metis identity.  In addition to doing research about our topic, we are expected to do an experiential immersion.  To develop a better understanding of my heritage, I have committed to immersing myself in Metis culture over the next two months. </p>
	<p> Here are some of the things I have done:</p>
